# Mastermind AI Experiments ðŸ§ ðŸŽ®

This repository showcases a collection of Mastermind solvers ranging from classic logic-based strategies (like Knuth and constraint propagation) to deep reinforcement learning agents. The goal is to explore, compare, and learn from a variety of algorithmic approaches to this classic puzzle game.

Each solver was built collaboratively with the help of Microsoft AI Copilot to blend clear logic, clean code structure, and insightful experimentation.
