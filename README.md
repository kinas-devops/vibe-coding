# vibe-coding

Vibe coding is a new approach to software development that heavily relies on AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to generate code from natural language prompts. Coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy, it involves using natural language to describe what you want the software to do, and then letting the AI handle the actual coding. Essentially, developers "vibe" the code into existence by providing high-level instructions and letting the AI figure out the details.

I created this repo for share my vibe coding, using multiple AI coding assistants and generators. The repo is going to be organized by vibe themes folders and the code files have references to the AI coding assistant/generator used.

The first vibe-coding try is based on MasterMind game...
